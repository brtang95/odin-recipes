    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days </p>
    <p> Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people</p>

    <h3>The Secret Behind This Classic Lasagna Recipe</h3>
    <p> From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>

<p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese. </p>

<h3>Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>   
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
  
    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
    <Li> <strong> Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</Li>
    <br>
    <Li> <strong> Let this simmer </strong> while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</Li>
    <br>
    <Li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</Li>
    <br>
    <Li><strong> Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></Li>
